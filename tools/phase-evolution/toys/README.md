# Toys (Phase Evolution)

This directory is reserved for minimal toy constructions used to validate the phase-evolution machinery.

Visibility rule:
- Toys may live here privately, but they should only be referenced in `success_register.md`
  once they achieve a registered success under the Tools Policy.
